Imad Assignment 2

In todayâ€™s modern era, developers have created and maintained countless of applications. Each with their own use and unique features. This report will give explanation to the application I have designed and created. In it will be looking at aspects such as the design specifications, the problems that occurred during the development process and overall purpose that the application possess.
The applications name is the Hound Feeder 2000. All creations were done in Android Studio. 
The application that we were tasked to design was a Tamagotchi Virutual pet application. Famously cloned from a pet toy in the 1990s.

The purpose of the pet toy was to resemble the experience of owning and taking care of a real dog and so the purpose of the application is to mimic that exact same experience. Therefore, the application would have features that would portray the ownership of a dog such as feeding and cleaning the virtual dog. As well as monitoring its health. 

One of the first few steps in The Development Stage of mobile application development is the designing of the user interface. As it is the first thing that a user sees and interacts with. It is important to have a capturing user interface that immerses the user in the concept of the application. This idea is expressed thoroughly in my user interface design. As I used an image of a dog in the welcome screen of the app when the user opens it. Which displays a background of multi-coloured paws and bones background that matched the highlights of the fur colour of the dog image used. Next, the homepage of the application where most of the interaction of the app will take place, uses a different image of a dog and has a pawn print background that matches the colour of the fur of the dog. 

After the completion of front-end of the application, we move on to the back end also known as the coding section of the development process. To ensure the proper functionality of the app, the program must be coded correctly. This would include making sure that there are no errors within it. Ranging from syntax to logic errors.

For the Tamagotchi app to function the code used had to follow as certain logic. Therefore, we had to begin with declaring variables that were going to be used in the program. Ranging from declaring the buttons and texts used, with their assigned string imports and IDs. Setting the buttons to click commands and functions that will allow the health, food and cleanliness of the virtualised dog to decease, and increase based on the clicks the user would need to input. Thus, outputting the experience of the taking care of a real dog.
A user can expect a fun and light-hearted experience when using the application, with a hint of tension. As this simulates owning a dog but without the stress of having real world consequences.
